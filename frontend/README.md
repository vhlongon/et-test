# How we work with frontend at etraveli

## Testing

At etraveli we are passionate about Test Driven Development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).
We strive towards writing tests first, and this effort has been made easier thanks to the adoption of 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [WallabyJS](https://wallabyjs.com/).

## Linting

In order to work towards a common code convention we use the awesome tools of [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), and 
[StyleLint](http://stylelint.io/). The former is configured to a large extent in the same way as 
[Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with some tweaks to work with our finest vintage (legacy) code. The
latter is an in-house crafted configuration to make for a solid set of rules regarding writing Scss.

## JavaScript

When suitable new code is written using React, state is managed with the help of [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), and to
be able to play with the shiniest new toys (ES language features) out there we use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), 
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) you say? Yes we do.

## CSS

Currently stylesheets are generated using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and we use [BEM](http://getbem.com/) as much
as we can.
